## Official RWKV checkpoint oracle

Official RWKV checkpoint behavior is the model-correctness oracle. The oracle
matrix covers no-cache logits, prefill state, teacher-forced cached decode,
causal loss, padding, and 64-token greedy generation. Every bundle records the
official source revision, code revision, checkpoint hashes, environment, and
exact command. RTX 4080 runs FP32/FP16/BF16; V100 runs FP32/FP16.

The official oracle and the reference implementation use separate source
paths and independent state containers. A mismatch is localized at projection,
decay, normalized key, WKV output/state, normalization, block output, and final
logits before changing model mathematics.

The oracle executes HF token-by-token for its blocking semantic comparison and
records the normal vectorized `B*T` execution separately. This prevents a CUDA
GEMM layout/order choice from being mistaken for a different checkpoint or
equation. FP32 logits use the official NumPy normalized metric with a calibrated
`2e-4` ceiling; recurrent and shift states pass either
`rtol=1e-4, atol=1e-5` or cosine `0.999999`. The cosine fallback avoids
rejecting a state for a handful of near-zero entries while its mean error is
below the FP32 accumulation noise floor.
Low-precision tensors must be finite with cosine at least `0.9999` for FP16 and
`0.999` for BF16. FP32/FP16 64-token greedy output must match exactly. BF16
must match the first 16 greedy tokens; the full 64-token equality is retained
as a diagnostic. This distinction is necessary because the FP16 source
checkpoint is cast to BF16 and small layout-dependent roundoff can flip a
near-tied token after many recurrent layers even while final-logit cosine stays
above the BF16 release floor.

The original aspirational targets—FP32 normalized `1e-4`, FP16/BF16 cosine
`0.9999`, and FP16 max-absolute logits `0.15`—remain in every case as
non-blocking diagnostics. The calibrated release thresholds are based on the
observed V100/RTX 4080 difference between mathematically identical contiguous
and transposed GEMM layouts; they do not permit non-finite values or a greedy
token mismatch. Per-layer and vectorized traces identify where accumulation
begins and remain diagnostic rather than additional gates.

## Optional FLA backend diagnostic

FLA is an optimized training/inference backend reference, not the correctness
oracle and not a runtime dependency. Its comparison lives under
[`benchmarks/fla`](../benchmarks/fla/README.md) and returns success by default
even when diagnostic thresholds are missed. Use `--require-thresholds` only in
an explicitly performance-backend-focused job.

The first RTX 4080 diagnostic bundle is archived at
[`benchmarks/fla/results/4080-reference-20260825`](../benchmarks/fla/results/4080-reference-20260825/README.md).

## lm_eval

Install the fixed harness:

```bash
python -m pip install "lm_eval==0.4.9.1"
```

Run the 48 units (3 models x 2 batch sizes x 8 tasks):

```bash
python evaluation/run_lm_eval_matrix.py \
  --output-dir results/lm_eval/v0.9.0 \
  --device cuda
python evaluation/validate_lm_eval_matrix.py \
  --result-dir results/lm_eval/v0.9.0
```

On a two-GPU V100 host, the checked-in launcher partitions the eight tasks,
runs both shards concurrently, merges them, and invokes the same validator:

```bash
MODEL_ROOT=/models/rwkv7-reference \
OUTPUT_DIR="$PWD/results/lm_eval/v0.9.0" \
PYTHON="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python" \
CODE_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
bash evaluation/run_lm_eval_v100_parallel.sh
```

`MODEL_ROOT` must contain `rwkv7_01b_hf`, `rwkv7_04b_hf`, and
`rwkv7_15b_hf` directories or symlinks. The merged release bundle is written
to `$OUTPUT_DIR/merged`; shard logs and manifests remain beside it for audit
and resumable reruns.

For the full eager reference run, independent units can occupy otherwise idle
V100 capacity without changing any lm_eval command or batch size:

```bash
python evaluation/run_lm_eval_v100_pool.py \
  --model-root /models/rwkv7-reference \
  --output-dir results/lm_eval/v0.9.0 \
  --python "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python" \
  --code-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

W&B remains optional and does not select the model backend. To mirror the
same formal units to an offline W&B bundle, set `WANDB_MODE=offline` and pass
`--wandb-args`; for optimized-backend acceptance, select the backend
separately with `RWKV7_BACKEND=optimized`:

```bash
WANDB_MODE=offline RWKV7_BACKEND=optimized \
python evaluation/run_lm_eval_v100_pool.py \
  --model-root /models/rwkv7-optimized \
  --output-dir results/lm_eval/optimized \
  --python "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python" \
  --code-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --wandb-args project=rwkv7-hf-lm-eval,group=optimized-v0.10
```

Local result JSON, sample logs, manifests, and exit status remain the release
evidence; W&B is only a mirror of those optimized-backend runs.

Do not pass `--wandb-args` in an environment where W&B is not installed. W&B
is not required for formal acceptance, and omitting it does not change the
model backend, dataset, metrics, or local provenance bundle.

The pool runs all 24 batch-one units first with six processes per V100, then
the higher-memory batch-eight units with two per V100. Every unit retains its
own raw command, logs, manifest and result directory before the normal merge
and validation scripts run.

Formal execution never uses `--limit`. Pull requests may set
`--smoke-limit`. Each task is an independent process with raw stdout,
stderr, sample logs, task config and manifest row. Batch 1/8 absolute metric
difference must be at most 0.001; Wikitext perplexity relative difference must
be at most 0.1%. The fixed execution shapes described in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md#numerical-reproducibility) prevent normal
FP16 GEMM shape selection from changing close multiple-choice decisions.

### Forced-Triton result status

At code revision `cfeb5aeca860ce444ebb3515a20cc22f7e2b090b`, V100,
RTX 4080, and RTX 4090 each completed all 48 formal units with
`RWKV7_BACKEND=optimized` and `RWKV7_KERNEL_IMPL=triton`. The RTX 4090
merged validator also passed the batch 1/8 metric and Wikitext perplexity
stability rules with no failures. This proves framework execution and metric
stability; it does not override the separate FP16 numerical diagnostics.

The cross-GPU compact report is
[`results/native-backend/TRITON_CFEB5AE_SUMMARY.md`](../results/native-backend/TRITON_CFEB5AE_SUMMARY.md).
Each final status deliberately remains `passed: false`: selected optimized vs
reference logits exceed `max_abs=0.15`, and clean-vs-FLA misses only its model
logits gate. Operator, recurrent state, cache, finite, cosine, and 64-token
greedy checks pass. Keeping functional acceptance and numerical promotion as
separate fields prevents a successful `lm_eval` run from hiding a kernel
precision decision.
